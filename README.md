Important notes:
* Only latest version of this plugin is supported
* This plugin can't be reloaded or loaded not at server startup

Known issues:
* [Anything that is not latest] Items in creative mode may not work as expected, or may not work at all

Known wontfix issues:
* [Anything that is not latest] Stats are not sent
* [1.8 and earlier] Can't control vehicle (Not directly translatable at network level, too much work to implement serverside)
* [1.4.7 and earlier] Server shows up as "incompatible" in the server list (Impossible to fix due to the lack of an way to verify the client version during server list ping)
